    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Anthony, I’m 21 years old and I was born and raised in Melbourne. My family is originally from
        Ukraine, with both my parents coming here to Australia in their early teens, so the language predominantly
        spoken in my household has always been English, with Russian being spoken as a close second. Because of this, I
        can fluently understand Russian when it’s spoken to me, but I cannot formulate sentences of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Education has been a rollercoaster for me. After VCE, I immediately went into a university course for Cyber
        Security and Networking. I found this to be a big mistake for two reasons; firstly, I wasn’t specifically
        interested in the course, and secondly, I was burnt out after my VCE Year and needed to have a break before
        commencing studying again. So, I ended up dropping out of that course and pursued full-time work instead, a few
        years have gone past, and studying has been constantly on my mind, so I’ve decided to take another shot at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of hobbies, I tend to be very obsessive over something new every few months and those obsessions are
        usually short lived until they come back again sometime in the future, my current craze is Barbequing. Since
        moving in with my girlfriend who is a chef, I felt very inadequate compared to her in the kitchen and have been
        striving to get better with cooking, so that I could prepare tasty food for her, just as she does for me. In the
        process of learning, I found that I have a knack with smoking and grilling food and have been slowly but surely
        getting more and more comfortable in that field. Now I find myself spending a bit too much money on all the cool
        BBQ gizmos and gadgets!
    </p>

    <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
    <p>
        I have always been Interested in IT, specifically the programming aspects of it. I’ve grown up around computers
        ever since I could remember, some of my earliest and fondest memories are of me silently watching my father
        completing his Doctorate of Computer Science, even though I had no clue what was going on I found it so
        interesting and captivating as he always would narrate what he was doing to me. As I got older and my father
        began teaching at RMIT, he was essentially a real-life textbook to me, he always spent his spare time teaching
        me new concepts in IT and helping me improve my understanding of many various topics. I thoroughly enjoy this
        shared interest and bond I have with my father, so much so that it’s still always our chosen topic of
        conversation every time I visit him. As of my personal understanding of It, I have touched base with HTML, CSS,
        SQL, PHP, JavaScript, Java and Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        RMIT was my first choice for studying for many reasons; Firstly, RMIT feels comfortable to me, as I began a
        course here in my VCE Year of high school, and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere presented by all the students
        and staff members. Also, RMIT being the university my dad studied at and taught at for some time, influenced my
        choice, as he has always spoke of his time there so incredibly highly. Lastly, RMIT is globally recognized so
        having the opportunity to study here is a huge honor and privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my studies here at RMIT, I expect to learn the skills, and knowledge necessary in following a career in
        IT. I also expect to learn teamwork, diligence, and many other useful skills to posses in the real world. I am
        excited for this journey ahead of me, and I am ever so grateful to be commencing it at RMIT.

        TO JOB</a>
    <p>
        The Job I have chosen as my ideal is Staff Software Engineer at Indeed. This job is a somewhat classic software
        engineer job, where I would be required to work in a team to design, develop, deploy, and maintain services,
        systems, and user-facing applications for Indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed is a free search engine for job seekers, helping people find placement in jobs that are suited for them.
        While also providing a platform for employers to post ads, view resumes of potential employees, and hire those

        performance, and reliability as well as implementing new features to further simplify the experiences for job
        seekers and employers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The position is appealing to me as software engineering is the field of work I have always wanted to be apart
        of. Indeed has helped me find jobs when I desperately needed them, so being able to help others that are in need
        of a job, while also pursuing my desire in working as a software engineer, seems to tick all the boxes for me as
        I wont only be doing what I enjoy, but I will be helping others while I’m at it.
    </p>
    <p>The requirements for obtaining this job include;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Completing a bachelor in computer science or equivalent practical experience</li>
        <li>Having experience with various programming languages</li>
        <li>Being able to work functionally as a team member</li>

        <li>Possessing the ability to functionally work in a highly collaborative environment</li>
        <li>Experience with building solutions for websites (preferably high traffic websites)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These requirements are typical for most software engineering jobs. Personally, I have little formal experience
        in software development, but I have been studying various programming languages for many years now on my own
        accord, so I have some experience and understanding of what would be needed from me for this job.
    </p>
    <p>
        I previously worked as part of a team for IT Consulting, so I do posses the knowledge and ability to work functionally as a member of a team. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am extremely passionate about this line of work, so I am always open to new ideas and concepts, as they only improve my level of skill and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have very basic experience with building solutions for websites, as I am currently managing a website that I built for my grandmother’s subscription-based business.
    </p>
    <p>
        My plan for obtaining the necessary skills and qualification would begin at completing my Bachelor of Information Technology, during my degree I would obtain all the technological, and communicational skills required to get a job as a software engineer. This combined with my experience as a developer, that I obtained prior to starting my degree, would help me land a job in the software engineering world. After some years of job experience in the field I would be able to apply and obtain my ideal job.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>
        The results from my personal profile tests indicate that I can work strongly both alone and within a team as certain roles, in terms of leadership I lack the ability to be socially in control and I tend to be better at following and completing set tasks as well as helping anyone that is struggling. I do take initiative in my own work and can recognise where others might need help or assistance, as I am aware of my emotions, therefore I better understand others’ emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
        My personal learning style involves both auditory and tactile aspects, I struggle getting anything done when I haven’t planned out exactly how, when and what I need to do. And In terms of retaining information from studying I require a quiet space to read and recite information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately, these test results along with my personal knowledge of myself indicate to me that I would fit in well with any team that has a leader established, as I can connect with others on an emotional level well, but tend to be reserved when it comes to delegating or controlling workflow of my peers. This is because I struggle with people’s opinion of me, and I have a desire to always be liked, so I have an irrational fear of offending someone by telling them what to do.
    </p>

    <h1>Project</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My Project Idea is to develop a smartphone app that utilises location-based services to locate and notify the
        user of any promotions in their immediate vicinity. For example, you are walking through the city, browsing
        through stores, you then receive a notification stating that a café 20 meters away from you is holding a
        promotion for a free muffin with any purchase of a large coffee. This application would immensely simplify the
        shopping experience for many users, eliminating the need to research coupons or deals at specific stores,
        instead the deals would be automatically presented to the user. Not only would this simplify the shopping
        experience, but it would also greatly help lower income families with their everyday shopping, allowing for
        money to be saved at every possible opportunity.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <p>
        My motivation behind developing a smartphone application that assists shoppers in finding promotions and deals,
        is that many Australians favour shopping through discounts, but doing so requires people to waste time browsing
        deals online to dictate what stores they would decide to shop at, it would be far simpler and more effective for
        those deals to automatically present themselves to users. 58% of Australians decide what stores they will go to
        based on promotions they have found through various sources, this means many people are missing out on
        opportunities to save more money on their days out as they are simply unaware of discounts near them. This would
        eliminate that issue, while also helping small businesses promote and compete with their larger competitors’
        prices.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This smartphone application would be simple and easily digestible for any users, no matter the age range. The
        features that would be included in this application begin at; utilizing location-based services to locate and
        present any deals nearby to the user in the form of a notification on their smartphone, showing them promotions
        on the go. Users will have the ability to choose the range in which the app locates deals, this could be
        immediately next to the user, within meters for those who choose to walk more, or the range can be expanded to
        kilometres, for those who prefer driving. The user will also have the ability to view any promotions on the app
        itself as there will be a map showing all the deals available in whatever area the user decides to look in, with
        an option to refine results. For example, If the user decides that they want promotions on shoes, they can
        refine the result to reflect that, and only show relevant stores that are holding deals on shoes specifically.
        Same goes for restaurants, groceries, or even entertainment, such as; performances, movie theatres, bowling
        alleys, etc. The refine result feature will also allow users to choose what form and range of discounts will be
        shown, including but not limited to; 30 percent off and higher, 2 for 1 discount, and price bundling deals. Not
        only would the user be able to refine results on the in-app map, but they would also be able to link this
        feature with the promotions on the go feature, notifying them only when the chosen categories are in range. The
        final main feature would include a catalogue that allows users to simply scroll through it, showing all the
        available promotions in a list format. The catalogue will show all promotions in whatever range and area is
        picked by the user, as well as also presenting an option to refine the results. The user interface would be very
        simplistic and user-friendly. The first thing users will be greeted with when opening the app would be a map
        showcasing all the available promotions as pins along with the correlating store names, the user will be able to
        view the promotions by tapping on the pins. The map will automatically be centred on the user by utilising
        location services, they would also be able to freely drag and zoom within this map. Apart from the map, there
        will be a hamburger dropdown menu that provides the user with all the other features, such as; the refine result
        feature, catalogue, distance settings for the promotion on the go aspect, and general app settings. Having the
        features and settings displayed as a dropdown menu will ensure the user interface isn’t cluttered and is
        extremely easy to navigate with especially few taps.
    </p>
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        In order to create this smartphone application, I would need to utilize one of the many mobile app development
        frameworks. The framework that would work best for this specific app would definitely be flutter, even though
        flutter utilises a less commonly used programming language, which is dart, it is easier to implement many
        services such as geolocation tracking. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit that was created by
        Google, it simplifies the creation of apps through a wide range of plugins that are backed by google and makes
        building the app for multiple platforms much easier. I would use the source code editor, Visual Studio Code, to
        write the necessary code for this application.
    </p>
    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of skills required to execute the development of this smartphone application, I would need to learn how
        to write code in the programming language, dart. Dart is similar to both C# and Java in syntax, and I have
        experience in both of these languages, so learning this language would be quick and easy. To write out the code
        I would need to know how to effectively use Visual Studio Code. I have used Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE
        for many years, so I have the expertise and knowledge needed for writing the applications code with this tool.
    </p>
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
        Ultimately, if this project was successful the experience of real-life shopping would be greatly improved for
        many people. Users would be able to not only save money, but also save a lot of valuable time taken up by
        researching discounts over the web. This would ensure that bargain shopping would be far more accessible and
        easier for everyone, especially for those that struggle to get by financially because of the devastating
        increase in product costs as of late. And on the other hand, small businesses will have a great avenue to
        promote their stores to a much wider audience. This is a product I would personally use daily, and I believe it
        would be greatly beneficial for many.
