    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Anthony, I’m 21 years old and I was born and raised in Melbourne. My family is originally from
        Ukraine, with both my parents coming here to Australia in their early teens, so the language predominantly
        spoken in my household has always been English, with Russian being spoken as a close second. Because of this, I
        can fluently understand Russian when it’s spoken to me, but I cannot formulate sentences of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Education has been a rollercoaster for me. After VCE, I immediately went into a university course for Cyber
        Security and Networking. I found this to be a big mistake for two reasons; firstly, I wasn’t specifically
        interested in the course, and secondly, I was burnt out after my VCE Year and needed to have a break before
        commencing studying again. So, I ended up dropping out of that course and pursued full-time work instead, a few
        years have gone past, and studying has been constantly on my mind, so I’ve decided to take another shot at it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of hobbies, I tend to be very obsessive over something new every few months and those obsessions are
        usually short lived until they come back again sometime in the future, my current craze is Barbequing. Since
        moving in with my girlfriend who is a chef, I felt very inadequate compared to her in the kitchen and have been
        striving to get better with cooking, so that I could prepare tasty food for her, just as she does for me. In the
        process of learning, I found that I have a knack with smoking and grilling food and have been slowly but surely
        getting more and more comfortable in that field. Now I find myself spending a bit too much money on all the cool
        BBQ gizmos and gadgets!

    <h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
    <p>
        I have always been Interested in IT, specifically the programming aspects of it. I’ve grown up around computers
        ever since I could remember, some of my earliest and fondest memories are of me silently watching my father
        completing his Doctorate of Computer Science, even though I had no clue what was going on I found it so
        interesting and captivating as he always would narrate what he was doing to me. As I got older and my father
        began teaching at RMIT, he was essentially a real-life textbook to me, he always spent his spare time teaching
        me new concepts in IT and helping me improve my understanding of many various topics. I thoroughly enjoy this
        shared interest and bond I have with my father, so much so that it’s still always our chosen topic of
        conversation every time I visit him. As of my personal understanding of It, I have touched base with HTML, CSS,
        SQL, PHP, JavaScript, Java and Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        RMIT was my first choice for studying for many reasons; Firstly, RMIT feels comfortable to me, as I began a
        course here in my VCE Year of high school, and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere presented by all the students
        and staff members. Also, RMIT being the university my dad studied at and taught at for some time, influenced my
        choice, as he has always spoke of his time there so incredibly highly. Lastly, RMIT is globally recognized so
        having the opportunity to study here is a huge honor and privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my studies here at RMIT, I expect to learn the skills, and knowledge necessary in following a career in
        IT. I also expect to learn teamwork, diligence, and many other useful skills to posses in the real world. I am
        excited for this journey ahead of me, and I am ever so grateful to be commencing it at RMIT.

    <h1>Project</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        My Project Idea is to develop a smartphone app that utilises location-based services to locate and notify the user of any promotions in their immediate vicinity. For example, you are walking through the city, browsing through stores, you then receive a notification stating that a café 20 meters away from you is holding a promotion for a free muffin with any purchase of a large coffee. This application would immensely simplify the shopping experience for many users, eliminating the need to research coupons or deals at specific stores, instead the deals would be automatically presented to the user. Not only would this simplify the shopping experience, but it would also greatly help lower income families with their everyday shopping, allowing for money to be saved at every possible opportunity.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <p>
        My motivation behind developing a smartphone application that assists shoppers in finding promotions and deals, is that many Australians favour shopping through discounts, but doing so requires people to waste time browsing deals online to dictate what stores they would decide to shop at, it would be far simpler and more effective for those deals to automatically present themselves to users. 58% of Australians decide what stores they will go to based on promotions they have found through various sources, this means many people are missing out on opportunities to save more money on their days out as they are simply unaware of discounts near them. This would eliminate that issue, while also helping small businesses promote and compete with their larger competitors’ prices.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This smartphone application would be simple and easily digestible for any users, no matter the age range. The features that would be included in this application begin at; utilizing location-based services to locate and present any deals nearby to the user in the form of a notification on their smartphone, showing them promotions on the go. Users will have the ability to choose the range in which the app locates deals, this could be immediately next to the user, within meters for those who choose to walk more, or the range can be expanded to kilometres, for those who prefer driving. The user will also have the ability to view any promotions on the app itself as there will be a map showing all the deals available in whatever area the user decides to look in, with an option to refine results. For example, If the user decides that they want promotions on shoes, they can refine the result to reflect that, and only show relevant stores that are holding deals on shoes specifically. Same goes for restaurants, groceries, or even entertainment, such as; performances, movie theatres, bowling alleys, etc. The refine result feature will also allow users to choose what form and range of discounts will be shown, including but not limited to; 30 percent off and higher, 2 for 1 discount, and price bundling deals. Not only would the user be able to refine results on the in-app map, but they would also be able to link this feature with the promotions on the go feature, notifying them only when the chosen categories are in range. The final main feature would include a catalogue that allows users to simply scroll through it, showing all the available promotions in a list format. The catalogue will show all promotions in whatever range and area is picked by the user, as well as also presenting an option to refine the results. The user interface would be very simplistic and user-friendly. The first thing users will be greeted with when opening the app would be a map showcasing all the available promotions as pins along with the correlating store names, the user will be able to view the promotions by tapping on the pins. The map will automatically be centred on the user by utilising location services, they would also be able to freely drag and zoom within this map. Apart from the map, there will be a hamburger dropdown menu that provides the user with all the other features, such as; the refine result feature, catalogue, distance settings for the promotion on the go aspect, and general app settings. Having the features and settings displayed as a dropdown menu will ensure the user interface isn’t cluttered and is extremely easy to navigate with especially few taps. 
    </p>
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        In order to create this smartphone application, I would need to utilize one of the many mobile app development frameworks. The framework that would work best for this specific app would definitely be flutter, even though flutter utilises a less commonly used programming language, which is dart, it is easier to implement many services such as geolocation tracking. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit that was created by Google, it simplifies the creation of apps through a wide range of plugins that are backed by google and makes building the app for multiple platforms much easier. I would use the source code editor, Visual Studio Code, to write the necessary code for this application.
    </p>
    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
        In terms of skills required to execute the development of this smartphone application, I would need to learn how to write code in the programming language, dart. Dart is similar to both C# and Java in syntax, and I have experience in both of these languages, so learning this language would be quick and easy. To write out the code I would need to know how to effectively use Visual Studio Code. I have used Visual Studio Code as my primary IDE for many years, so I have the expertise and knowledge needed for writing the applications code with this tool.
    </p>
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
        Ultimately, if this project was successful the experience of real-life shopping would be greatly improved for many people. Users would be able to not only save money, but also save a lot of valuable time taken up by researching discounts over the web. This would ensure that bargain shopping would be far more accessible and easier for everyone, especially for those that struggle to get by financially because of the devastating increase in product costs as of late. And on the other hand, small businesses will have a great avenue to promote their stores to a much wider audience. This is a product I would personally use daily, and I believe it would be greatly beneficial for many.
